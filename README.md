* :bookmark: **Binary Search:** <br />
In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
The main idea of the algorithms is to divide the given sorted array A into two subarrays at each step and look for the key element K in one of two subarrays.
