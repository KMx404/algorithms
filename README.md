In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.
The main idea of the algorithms is to divide the given sorted array A into two subarrays at each step and look for the key element K in one of two subarrays. <br />

* :bookmark: **Linear Search:** <br />
In this searching technique, we compare each array element with the key element (k), that we are looking for.
It's a very simple algorithm, but you may need to check every element of the array. If the key element is presented in the array, then the search is successful, otherwise is not. <br />

Jump search is a searching algorithms for sorted arrays. The basic idea is to check fewer elements(than linear algebra) by jumping ahead.
